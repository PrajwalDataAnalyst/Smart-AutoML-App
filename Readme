# Smart AutoML App: Regression & Classification with Multiple Algorithms

---

## Overview

This project is an AutoML (Automated Machine Learning) Streamlit app that allows users to upload any CSV dataset and automatically trains multiple machine learning models for either regression or classification tasks. It then selects the best performing model based on cross-validation scores, and provides a simple UI to make predictions on new data inputs.

## Supported Algorithms

The app supports a variety of popular regression and classification algorithms, each suited for different data types and problem complexities.

### Regression Algorithms:

1. **Linear Regression**
   - *Concept*: Fits a straight line to the data that best predicts the target variable as a weighted sum of input features.
   - *Use case*: When relationship between features and target is linear.
   - *Key hyperparameters*: None in basic form.

2. **Ridge Regression**
   - *Concept*: Like linear regression but adds a penalty for large coefficients to reduce model complexity and overfitting.
   - *Use case*: When data is multicollinear or to prevent overfitting.
   - *Key hyperparameters*: `alpha` (strength of regularization).

3. **Lasso Regression**
   - *Concept*: Similar to Ridge but can shrink some coefficients to zero, effectively selecting important features.
   - *Use case*: Feature selection and regularization.
   - *Key hyperparameters*: `alpha`.

4. **Random Forest Regressor**
   - *Concept*: An ensemble of decision trees trained on random subsets of data/features; averages predictions to reduce variance.
   - *Use case*: Non-linear relationships, robust to noise/outliers.
   - *Key hyperparameters*: `n_estimators`, `max_depth`, `min_samples_split`.

5. **Decision Tree Regressor**
   - *Concept*: Splits data into regions based on feature thresholds, predicting average target per region.
   - *Use case*: Interpretable, handles non-linear data.
   - *Key hyperparameters*: `max_depth`, `min_samples_split`.

6. **Support Vector Regressor (SVR)**
   - *Concept*: Tries to fit data within a margin while minimizing prediction errors, supports kernels for non-linear data.
   - *Use case*: Small-to-medium datasets, non-linear regression.
   - *Key hyperparameters*: `kernel`, `C`, `epsilon`.

7. **K-Nearest Neighbors Regressor (KNN)**
   - *Concept*: Predicts target by averaging targets of k closest data points.
   - *Use case*: Simple, non-parametric; sensitive to noisy data.
   - *Key hyperparameters*: `n_neighbors`, `weights`.

8. **XGBoost Regressor**
   - *Concept*: Gradient boosting ensemble that builds trees sequentially to correct previous errors. Highly accurate and efficient.
   - *Use case*: Complex, large datasets with non-linearities.
   - *Key hyperparameters*: `n_estimators`, `max_depth`, `learning_rate`.

9. **AdaBoost Regressor**
   - *Concept*: Boosts weak learners sequentially, focusing more on samples previously mispredicted.
   - *Use case*: Improves performance of simple base models.
   - *Key hyperparameters*: `n_estimators`, `learning_rate`.

### Classification Algorithms:

1. **Logistic Regression**
   - *Concept*: Models probability of class membership using a logistic function.
   - *Use case*: Binary or multinomial classification with linear decision boundary.
   - *Key hyperparameters*: `C` (inverse regularization strength).

2. **Random Forest Classifier**
   - *Concept*: Ensemble of decision trees voting on the most popular class.
   - *Use case*: Handles complex, high-dimensional data well.
   - *Key hyperparameters*: Similar to regressor.

3. **Decision Tree Classifier**
   - *Concept*: Splits data recursively based on feature thresholds to classify samples.
   - *Use case*: Interpretable, fast.
   - *Key hyperparameters*: Similar to regressor.

4. **Support Vector Classifier (SVC)**
   - *Concept*: Finds hyperplane that best separates classes, uses kernels for complex boundaries.
   - *Use case*: High-dimensional or non-linear data.
   - *Key hyperparameters*: `C`, `kernel`.

5. **K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier (KNN)**
   - *Concept*: Classifies a sample based on majority class of nearest neighbors.
   - *Use case*: Simple, non-parametric.
   - *Key hyperparameters*: `n_neighbors`, `weights`.

6. **XGBoost Classifier**
   - *Concept*: Boosting ensemble tailored for classification, optimized for speed and accuracy.
   - *Use case*: Large, complex classification problems.
   - *Key hyperparameters*: Similar to regressor.

7. **AdaBoost Classifier**
   - *Concept*: Boosts weak classifiers focusing on harder samples sequentially.
   - *Use case*: Improves base classifiersâ€™ performance.
   - *Key hyperparameters*: Similar to regressor.

## Understanding Overfitting and Underfitting

- **Overfitting**: Model learns noise and details in the training data, performing well on training but poorly on new data.
  *How to overcome:*
  - Use simpler models or reduce complexity.
  - Use regularization techniques (Ridge, Lasso).
  - Prune decision trees or limit max depth.
  - Use cross-validation for tuning hyperparameters.
  - Collect more training data.

- **Underfitting**: Model is too simple to capture underlying patterns, resulting in poor performance on both training and test data.
  *How to overcome:*
  - Use more complex models.
  - Add more relevant features.
  - Reduce regularization.
